============

As of 18 August, this repo has been cleaned of Phase 1 content following
[git_process.md](https://github.mit.edu/brass/mitll/blob/master/documents/development/git_process.md).

`documents` contains markdown files with draft descriptions of each
challenge problem following the provided format. The APIs describing the
interfaces for TA and TH in each CP case are given in
`documents/swagger-yaml` as valid [Swagger](http://swagger.io) files---with
automatically produced markdown also checked in for convenience.

All of these are currently still under revision and will change through the
process as we refine our research goals.

This readme will be expanded with instructions for running the system as we
being to produce artefacts in the run up to RR1.
